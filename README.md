The Drug Response Prediction System is designed to predict whether a human body is sensitive or resistant to a specific drug based on given generic and biological input features. This project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to study drug–response relationships and provide predictive insights that can support personalized medicine.
The system analyzes input parameters such as drug characteristics and patient-related attributes to classify the response into sensitive or resistant categories. This helps in understanding how different individuals may react to the same medication, reducing trial-and-error in drug selection.
